## Description

To develop the application, you are required to:
1. Create a table called TODO_ITEMS, within the todo database via SQL statements (READ, INSERT, EDIT, DELETE).
2. Develop a server that exposes API endpoints to READ, INSERT, EDIT and DELETE items in TODO_ITEMS table.
3. Using a browser and Postman, do HTTP requests to the API endpoints. Inspect HTTP trace.
4. Create a front-end, which runs independently with static data and later retrieves data from database using API endpoints.
5. Receive feedback from peers/colleagues/mentors etc., to improve upon the first version of your application
